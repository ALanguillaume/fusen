> Inflate your package from your flat Rmd

A fusen is an origami. It is a page of paper that you fold in a specific way so that at the end, you can magically inflate it to let a nice box appear.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/fusen-origami.jpg")
```

Similarly, the {fusen} package uses one page of Rmarkdown, that you fill in a specific way so that at the end, you can magically `inflate()` it to let a nice package appear.

## Installation

You can install the development version of {fusen} from GitHub:
