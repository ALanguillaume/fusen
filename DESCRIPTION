Description: Use RMarkdown First method to build your package. Start your
    package with documentation, functions, examples and tests in the same
    unique file.  Everything can be set from the RMarkdown template
    provided in your project, then inflated as a package. Inflating the
    template copies the relevant chunks and sections in the appropriate
    files required for package development.
