# fusen

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

A fusen is an origami. It is a page of paper that you fold in a specific
way so that at the end, you can magically inflate it to let a nice box
appear.

Similarly, the {fusen} package uses one page of Rmarkdown, that you fill
in a specific way so that at the end, you can magically `inflate()` it
to let a nice package appear.
